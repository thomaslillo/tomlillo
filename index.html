    <!--- current work -->
    <p>Currently, I'm a Backend Software Developer at <a href="https://environicsanalytics.com/">Environics Analytics</a> in Toronto where I'm building new APIs with .NET Core and doing some cloud/data stuff. I've also co-founded and operates a data conference and workshop company called <a href="http://www.datathon.ca">Datathon Analytics Events</a> where we teach students to code and connect them with industry. The Datathon website is down at the moment to avoid paying for hosting but you can see some of my work <a href="https://brocku.ca/brock-news/tag/datathon/">here</a>.</p>
    
    <!--- who I am -->
    <p>Most of my experience has been in data engineering and analytics, but I love to just about everything tech.</p>
